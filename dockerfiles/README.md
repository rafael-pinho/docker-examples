# docker-files

Dockerfiles for build docker containers. You can see a list of images below:

- [alpine with bash only](./alpine)
- nodejs - alpine based
 - [v6.2.2](./nodejs/6.2.2)
 - [v6.2.2 with oracledb packages](./nodejs/6.2.2/oracledb) 
- rabbitmq - alpine based
 - [rabbitmq v3.6.1](./rabbitmq/3.6.1)

WARNING - I just use those dockerfiles to learn docker, make tests and in small personal projects. 
If you want to use in production or serious project, please, search for official repositories in [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com).
